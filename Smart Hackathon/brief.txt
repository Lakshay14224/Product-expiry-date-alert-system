Product expiry date alert system

Annually 2-5% (Approx) of the total population consume expired medicines.
Out of which many of them pass through serious problems.This is done by the retailers to sell their expired inventory
because of their negligence they do not remember to return the expired drugs on time.
In the app, the user needs to manually enter the product name’s, purchase date’s, expiration date’s, and it generates 
reminders several days before the expiration date.
However, this manual entry of each purchased product’s name and expiration date are tiresome, time-consuming, and not efficient.
The app in  attempts to develop an easier way for entering the product information by only scanning the barcode of the 
product using the smartphone’s camera. 
When a product barcode is scanned, the app gets the product name,manufacturing date,expiry date  and its unit price from the store's database and 
displays them in a list box.
After all this we will get a notification or pop up in the app which will remind the user about medicine expiry 
RESULT:

 A prototype of the proposed smart expiry system as shown is to be developed.
 In the proposed system, the expiry date is scanned using barcode.
 And user will be reminded of expiry through notification.
